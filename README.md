# Jet Chess Engine 🛠️

Jet is a cutting-edge chess engine renowned for its highly intelligent chess playing capabilities. With its ultra-fast move generator, advanced search algorithms, and neural network-based evaluation system, Jet pushes the boundaries of chess engine development. 🚀

## Key Features 🌟

- **Ultra Fast Move Generator**: Jet's move generator is optimized for speed, capable of processing up to 1 billion nodes per second on high-end hardware like the i7 14700KF. ⚡️

- **GPL 3 Licensed**: Jet is released under the GNU General Public License Version 3, affirming its commitment to openness and collaboration within the community. 📜

- **NNUE Evaluation with Autovectorized Inference**: Jet leverages Neural Network with Efficiently Updatable Neural Network (NNUE) evaluation, utilizing autovectorized inference for position evaluations. 🧠

- **Search features**: Jet employs Alpha-beta pruning alongside advanced search techniques like Late Move Reduction and Singular Extensions to optimize its search, enhancing computational efficiency and playing strength. 🔍

## Building Instructions 🏗️

### Required Tools 🛠️

- Make
- Clang compiler (GCC works but not preferred)

### Building on Windows 🖥️

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafid-dev/jet.git
cd jet
make -j CXX=clang++
```

### Building on Linux 🐧

Replace `XX` with your Linux's clang version or leave as `clang++` if symlinked.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafid-dev/jet
cd jet
make -j CXX=clang++-XX
```

Ensure everything works fine by running `./Jet bench` and verifying that the nodes match the current commit bench nodes. ✔️
